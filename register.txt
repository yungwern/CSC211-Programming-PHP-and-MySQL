Part A:

1. isset() - This function is fairly simple as it basically explains itself in the name.
When breaking it apart you can see that it means "is set." This can be used when information that
is submitted from an HTML form doesn't have a value, like a checkbox. Normally if a user doesn't fill out a 
textbox the value of that is still sent but its received as empty. With checkboxes that doesn't exist so we use 
the isset() command to to check if the variable is set. If it is then isset() will return a value of True and if 
it isn't then it will return a value of False.

2. empty() - This function is used to check if a user input that was submitted from an HTML form has a value, 
like isset(). Unlike isset() however, it can be used for many different things. The value that was submitted can 
include things like an empty string (""), zero (0), NULL, false or an undefined variable. Where isset() will see an 
empty string or zero as still having a value, empty() will recognize it as what it is, empty and return True. 

3. is_numeric() - This function is used specifically to check numeric values. This can be very helpful when 
making sure that what the user inputs is only valid when it contains a numeric value or string such as "123" 
or "12.34." It will return false even if the user submits partial numeric values like "123xyz" so for validating 
a birth year or phone numbers it can be very useful. 


Part B:
Brief comment about Part B. I already added most of this in my original handle_reg.php file as I thought that was 
part of the initial assignment to add error handling. So I went ahead and added the CSS class into the head to allow
for styling of the error messages as well as a is_numeric check as an additional check for the year input. I just wanted
to provide you with a breif explanation of why my two handle_reg assignments looked so similar.
